# Double Precision

The Python/GTK program **double-precision.py** is designed to aid in understanding how the IEEE 754 Double Precision values
are created using 64 bits.

This program combines traditional creation of the GUI with creation using GTK.Builder and an XML file created using *Glade*.
The header bar and the widgets on it were created using Glade. They have been left in this program as an exmaple template and 
provide limited functionality to the main objective of demonstrating Double Precision.
